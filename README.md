# Car-Safety-Prediction-using-Random-Forest-Classifier
This project analyzes a car safety dataset to predict whether a car is safe or unsafe using a Random Forest Classifier. The workflow includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, performance evaluation using a confusion matrix, and identification of the most and least important features influencing safety ratings.
